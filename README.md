# HERCULE
A naive implementation of HERCULE, an attack story reconstruction system using community discovery on correlated log graph.<br>
Now I have implemented HERCULE's key function -- social network detection using louvain method(use python-louvain package). The platform directory contains the main source code and some utilities.<br>
The dataset I use is SJTU's TCP/UDP connection logs<br>
This is a SJTU PRP project guided by Prof. Futai Zou<br>
